You'll learn to style your web page in different ways.
The styling technique that adds css code inside HTML elements is called : inline css

inline css is easy to add to your code but presents some disadvantages. for example, to apply the same style to more than one HTML element..
css code needs to be repeated

an alternative styling technique is internal css. internal css is used to style the entire page.
The <style> container tag is added within the html document to group all the css code for the page.

<style>
	p{
	  color: orchid;
	}
</style>

<body>
	<p>Explore the city.</p>
	<p>Discover the gems.</p>
	<p>take a free tour.</p>
</body>

complete the code to style all the h2 elements in the page using internal css
<style>
	h2{
	color:yellow;
	}
</style>

the way css code is added depens on the styling technique you are using.
Inline css code is added to 
individual html elements


The styling technique that groups all the css code inside <style> tag is called ...
Internal css


<style>
	h3{
	color:red;
	font-size:small;
	}
</style>

the style defined in the internal css code above will be applied to
-> all level 3 headings in the page

selector <- p {
		color:green;
		text-align: left;
		}

the selector in the css code matches the html tags you want to target.
COmplete the internal css code to style the buttons in the page.

button{
	color:green;
	}


style the h1 headings in the page using internal css

<style>
	h1{
	color: orange;
	}
</style>


selectors are used with...
internal css


separate multiple selectors with a comma to apply the same style to
different elements. this makes your css code simpler.

create a rule that applies the same style to h1 and p elements

<style>
	h1,p{
		color:black;
		background-color: yellow;
	}
</style>

its best practice to include all the internal css code in the <head> of the page.


<head>
	<style>
	h1{
		color: orchid;
		background-color: lime;
	}
	p{
		color: orchid;
	}
	button{
		font-size: large;
		color: lightyellow;
		background-color: orchid;
		}
	</style>
</head>

<body>
	<h1>Explore the city.</h1>
	<p>Discovere gems.</p>
	<button>Take a free tour</button>
</body>

<p>Explore the city.</p>
<p>Discover the gems.</p>

<style>
	p{
		color: maroon;
	}
</style>

paragraphs in the page

<style>
	h1,p{
	text-align: center;
	}
</style>
