The border property’s great for helping us see the difference between these 2 types of HTML element.

 

Do you remember how to use the border property?
<button style = "border: solid">Click me</button>

block = <p>, <ul>,<li>,<h1>
inline=<button>,<b>,<u>,<i>,<label>,<input> 

inline element are nested inside block elements

ex. <p>
	<a href: "link">link</a>
    </p> 	 

block level elements always starts from new line so <br> tag is not necessary for block level element

Form elements like <input> and <label> are inline elements so <br> is required

<p>first<br>
second<br>
third</p>
-> this is three line paragraph element


<button>first</button><br>
<button>second</button><br>
<button>third</button>
-> this is three line button
⭐ there are two types of HTML element: inline and block

⭐ Block-level elements always start on (and end with) a new line

⭐ Inline elements don’t start on a new line
